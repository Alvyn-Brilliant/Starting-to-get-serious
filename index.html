        This is the 3rd site I have created since I first started teaching myself Web Design on Friday 8/29/2025.<br>
        I am still learning composition, and "good design" technique, but considering I didn't think I would have even reached a point<br>
        where I understood the first thing about coding let alone created and posted a 3rd website in such a short amount of time,<br>
        I have to feel a little proud of myself.<br>
         This iteration was intended to accomplish learning how to animate with CSS.<br>
        Though it is a simple example, I at least figured out how to start wraping my head around the concept.<br>
        I still have a long ways to go on this journey, but at least I am building a make-shift portfolio of sorts.<br>

         I will probably start designing a more serious and functional/interactive website after this one. Wish me luck.<br>
